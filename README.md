# List Adapter for Java Framework 1.4.2
## Overview
This project aims to provide an adapter for the List interface in Java Framework 1.4.2, along with adapters for other related interfaces such as Collection, ListIterator, and Iterator. These adapters are implemented using the Vector class from CLDC 1.1.

The primary goal of this project is to bridge the functionality gap between the List interface in Java Framework 1.4.2 and the Vector class in CLDC 1.1, allowing developers to leverage the features of the List interface while working within the constraints of the older framework.

## Features
- Adapter classes for List, Collection, ListIterator, and Iterator interfaces.
- Implementation based on the Vector class from CLDC 1.1.
- Test-driven development (TDD) approach using JUnit for ensuring code quality and reliability.
## Getting Started
To use the List Adapter in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/list-adapter-java-1.4.2.git`
2. Add the necessary files to your Java project.
3. Import the required adapter classes into your codebase.
3. Utilize the List Adapter classes as per your requirements.

## Usage
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use the List Adapter:
````
import java.util.List;
import com.example.listadapter.ListAdapter;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new ListAdapter instance
        List<String> myList = new ListAdapter<String>();

        // Add elements to the list
        myList.add("Item 1");
        myList.add("Item 2");
        myList.add("Item 3");

        // Iterate over the list
        for (String item : myList) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}
